# Yivry's Factorio Blueprints

These blueprints / blueprint books can be directly imported into Factorio. The easiest way to do so is to view the "raw" file, copy everything, and paste it in the in-game "Import string" dialog. The blueprints are explained below, linking directly to their raw versions.

Unless specified otherwise, the blueprints are: made using the Space Age DLC, still usable in 2.0, not compatible with 1.x.

## Books

* [Prefiltered Items](https://github.com/yivry/factorio-blueprints/raw/refs/heads/main/prefiltered-items)  
  Contains parameterised blueprints for items that have filter-capability (inserters, splitters, etc). Using this book guarantees filters to be set before the item is actually build, preventing unwanted situations.  
  Intended use (as explained in the book): Place the item-books in place of that item on your hotbar. Each item-book defaults to its unfiltered version, and by (with default keybinds) shift-scrolling you can get the filtered versions.
